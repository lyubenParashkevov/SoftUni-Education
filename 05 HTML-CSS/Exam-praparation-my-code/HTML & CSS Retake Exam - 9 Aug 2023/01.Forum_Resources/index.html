                <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                    that,
                    but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                    accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to
                    attain
                    uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a
                    company
                    work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
